# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Fake news detection using different Machine learning models

This project focuses on predicting fake news using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes labeled instances of both fake and true news articles. By leveraging text processing and classification algorithms, the project aims to build a model that accurately distinguishes between fake and true news.

Key steps involved:

1)Importing and exploring the datasets.
2)Preprocessing the text data to remove noise.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training various classification models to identify fake news.
Evaluating the performance of these models using accuracy and classification metrics.
Machine Learning Models include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
Random Forest
The project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of fake news and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting misinformation with 99% accuracy
